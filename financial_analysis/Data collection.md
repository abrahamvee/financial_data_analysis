## Regular updates
Where is the data available?  How to access it?

## Frameworks needed for Real time processing
Is it going to be continuous access? (websockets)
Is it going to be done in batches? (pandas/dask)

## Data storage
How is the data going to be stored? Where is it going to be stored?

## Automation
Regarding the scheduling of jobs. To review: cronjobs, task scheduler
